# Section 4: Scenario-Based Questions 
## Summary
### Task 1: Snowflake Query Optimization
A query on a large Snowflake table is performing poorly. It filters data based on the
neighborhood column. How would you improve its performance?
### Task 2: Airflow DAG Creation
Design an Airflow DAG that:
1. Extracts data from the Airbnb dataset stored in an S3 bucket.
2. Transforms the data using a Python script.
3. Loads the transformed data into a PostgreSQL database.
### Task 3: AWS EC2 Troubleshooting
An ETL process running on an EC2 instance is experiencing memory issues and
crashing. What steps would you take to diagnose and resolve the problem?
### Task 4: AWS Lambda Implementation
Develop a Python AWS Lambda function that:
1. Reads new reviews from the Airbnb dataset stored in DynamoDB.
2. Saves these reviews as JSON files in an S3 bucket.
